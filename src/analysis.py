    Condition number of the NLP's objective Hessian at the solution `w`.

    The MSE objective's gradient is taken symbolically from CasADi, then the
    Hessian is built by central finite differences on that gradient
    (column j = [grad(w + eps e_j) - grad(w - eps e_j)] / 2eps), symmetrized,
    and its 2-norm condition number returned.

    This is an optimization-health metric: a large condition number means the
    objective is locally ill-scaled (a long, narrow valley), which is exactly
    the regime where a BFGS-based SQP needs many more iterations than IPOPT's
    exact-Hessian interior-point steps to make progress.

    `w, shapes` identify the network; `X_train, y_train` are needed because the
    Hessian depends on the data the objective is evaluated on.
