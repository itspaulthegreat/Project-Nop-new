──────────────────────
Unconstrained baseline: plain Adam gradient descent on the same MSE
objective, with no constraints at all. This is the "what everyone
already does" reference point the constrained-NLP (IPOPT / SQP)
results are measured against.

The gradient is obtained from CasADi (ca.gradient) so the comparison
uses the exact same objective expression as the constrained solves --
only the algorithm and the presence of constraints differ.
